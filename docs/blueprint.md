# **App Name**: Alpha Insights

## Core Features:

- Data Registration: Allows trainers to register physical evaluation data including body measurements, body composition, and bone density.
- Protocol Implementation: Implements various protocols such as Pollock 3/4/7, Guedes, Faulkner, Jackson & Pollock, YMCA, and protocols adapted for public service entrance exams.
- Automated Analysis: Automatically generates analysis comparing different evaluations (evolution, regression, or stability), aiding in providing insights and trends.
- Textual Report Generation: Generates a textual analysis automatically for the student's report.
- Training Suggestion Tool: Generates an interpretation of the user's physical form to support trainer's training choices (not prescriptions). This interpretation may depend on past measurements as well. The trainer is meant to use this tool and always override the training suggestions it generates. DO NOT generate any clinical recommendations!
- Alpha Trainer Integration: Integrates evaluation data into the Alpha Trainer ecosystem to help with training suggestions.
- Reporting and Storage: Allows trainers to generate and store reports.
